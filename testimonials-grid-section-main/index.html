                been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who
                had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro
                course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
                thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling -
                time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully
                switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR
                startup. ”

                “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of
                code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me
                learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a
                former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about
                the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint.
                They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for
                assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
                outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that
                no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it
                during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It
                certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after
                receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
